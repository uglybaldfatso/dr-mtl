pennies.</p><p>Several times, consistently, it was to figure out who she was—but all of that must have felt blatant to the old woman.</p><p>-no.</p><p>The saying that he had no name was true. The

have to be special to that man. I will also consider him special.</p><p>So I asked for a name. I didn’t want to say a trivial name that I didn’t cherish, cherish, or attach special meaning to. To be special to him. For me to regard him as a special being.</p><p>“… … aria… … .”</p><p>Noir Jebela.</p><p>She gasped and stared at Eugene.</p><p>Aria, Aria… … its name. The memories that remained vaguely came to my mind more clearly the moment I heard the name ‘Aria’.</p><p>So I couldn’t stand it. Noir swallowed his panting breath. I don’t want to think of it as a special name.</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>Passion and agitation. I never thought I would see such an expression from Noir Jebella, who always had a sense of composure and laughter.</p><p>If it were for another reason, Eugene would have felt the joy too. If it was Noir’s evil, she might have even thought of actively using it.</p><p>But now I couldn’t. Noir’s expressions and emotions. It was because the ‘name’ that was the same as her reverse was applied to Eugene as well.</p><p>The Witch of Twilight, the Saint of the War God. The impression that comes out of the name ‘Aria’ is much stronger than the impression that comes out of those names.</p><p>so it goes deep Everyone looked this way in surprise at the sudden attack of Noir. Of course, Senya and Seongnyeo tried to approach Eugene, but Eugene reached out her hand to stop them, saying that it was okay.</p><p>“Why stop?”</p><p>Noir spat. Her eyes still looked like they were about to burst into tears. Yujin stared into her shaking eyes and opened her mouth.</p><p>“just.”</p><p>“just… … ?”</p><p>Noir’s voice trembled. She immediately reached out and grabbed Eugene by the collar.</p><p>“Aren’t you looking at me too funny? It’s true that I love you, and wished I’d killed you somewhere else. So, I, I… … It’s not like I can’t kill you right here and now.”</p><p>Right now, Eugene is having a hard time even controlling her own body. With just a little bit of strength, Noir would be able to break his neck like breaking a tree branch.</p><p>In order to prove that he wasn’t speaking out of simple bravado, Noir showed off his intent to kill. However, Yujin’s expression did not change. He still looked at Noir with gloomy eyes, and opened her mouth again.</p><p>“I just thought I needed to talk to you right now.”</p><p>“… … .”</p><p>“Are you looking at me funny? Do you really think so? I’ve never taken you lightly.”</p><p>Queen of Dreams, Noir Jebella. She is Yujin’s old nemesis. Eugene has never looked down on the dignity and power of her existence. Even as she spat her nickname of “Queen of Gal X”, whenever she imagined her battle with her, she always had her own defeat in mind.</p><p>“… … conversation… … .”</p><p>Noir muttered in a low voice.</p><p>A name floating in my head. Memories that keep spreading. Noir closed her eyes once, catching her breath.</p><p>The collar that was held was released. But his hand did not move away. Rather, it came a little closer to Eugene. A white, soft hand caressed Yujin’s cheek.</p><p>ㅡHwaaaak! Bat wings soared behind Noir’s back.</p><p>“I don’t want to show it.”</p><p>Noir whispered in a low voice. Wings as big as the wings of Pegasus Apollo. The wings that soared up slowly came down and wrapped around Eugene and Noir.</p><p>“I don’t even want to hear it.”</p><p>Eugene did not restrain her actions. because it was the same She revealed that Hamel was reincarnated to important people, but she did not tell the story of Agaroth’s reincarnation.</p><p>What do you mean by saying that in the first place? Unlike Hamel 300 years ago, Agaroth is a figure from the age of mythology.</p><p>What I will share with Noir from now on is a story that is difficult for people of that time to understand.</p><p>‘I think it’s going to cause some misunderstanding.’</p><p>I thought so, but on second thought, it didn’t matter. It’s not the first time today, is it? Noir broke into the receptionist’s banquet to congratulate Eugene, and after that, they even had a private conversation.</p><p>The late night tryst at Jebela Park also spread photos on the continent. misunderstanding? If it was a misunderstanding, it was there from the very beginning.</p><p>“You are thorough.”</p><p>Eugene grinned at Noir’s face in front of him.</p><p>It wasn’t just the sights and sounds around her that her wings blocked. Even the voices of Mer, who was in the cloak, and Senya, who had been mentally linked, and the voices of the saints could not be heard. It is because of the powerful magic barrier spread through her wings.</p><p>“Because I want to have a conversation just the two of us.”</p><p>Noir whispered. Wings wrapped around all sides. A black darkness thicker than the night. But even in this darkness, Eugene’s face is clearly visible.</p><p>Feelings calmed down a bit.</p><p>“You’re the one who said let’s talk. my… … .”</p><p>to say the name.</p><p>“Hamel.”</p><p>I thought it was a bit difficult. I said my name though. Noir wanted to call that name.</p><p>“How long will you be around?”</p><p>His face with Noir is too close. Her thick hair came down like a blackout curtain and wrapped around Eugene. The jingling ring also came down and lay on her Eugene’s collarbone.</p><p>“I.”</p><p>Both hands are wrapped around Eugene’s cheeks. slowly, very slowly… … The hand started to move. Long fingers delicately caressed Eugene’s cheeks and moved along the contours of his face.</p><p>“Until you are satisfied.”</p><p>I wanted the real feeling of touching it directly with my fingers. Not in my memory, I wanted the real thing that existed in front of my eyes and came into contact with it. Noir chewed on his lips and groped for Eugene’s face.</p><p>Lips chewed in desperation for recalling something they didn’t want to recall. Noir’s breath is mixed with the smell of blood.</p><p>It was the same with Eugene. He bled several times in battle. The two smelled blood on each other’s breath.</p><p>The smell of such blood strongly connected them to each other. The smell of blood filled the voids in my faint memories. end of each other.</p><p>“… … Whoops.”</p><p>Noir laughed involuntarily. She tilted her head a little closer.</p><p>The distance got too close. It was to the extent that his eyes couldn’t contain all of Eugene’s image. It didn’t matter though. Feeling it with her fingertips, looking into her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t think they look alike.”</p><p>Noir’s lips parted slightly.</p><p>“He looks a little rougher. Yeah, it’s not that clunky. fairly… … I think I thought he was a cool guy. A man who looks good in armor. A man who is good at riding horses. A man who looks good with a big sword.”</p><p>“… … .”</p><p>“A man who is good at being among men. A man who is good at commanding commands. A man who suits the battlefield well.”</p><p>shaggy hair. intense eyes. Clear facial features. Even though it’s touchy, when it’s serious, it’s infinitely serious. Laughing and being angry, being sensitive to ‘mine’… … .</p><p>“Ahaha… … .”</p><p>Noir laughed once more.</p><p>“No. He is quite like you.”</p><p>I’m not talking about the face. Attitude and atmosphere, things like that are similar.</p><p>“is it.”</p><p>Eugene replied with a wry smile. Not the same. After all, it’s natural because it’s a different person. But even the resemblance could not be denied.</p><p>“It’s just a resemblance. I am not Agaroth.”</p><p>“How am I?”</p><p>Noir asked with a smile.</p><p>“Do you think you look like her?”</p><p>“any.”</p><p>“but. It wouldn’t be very similar. After all, she is a human, and I am a dreamer.”</p><p>“I guess so.”</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>Noir’s hand, which was groping his face, was on Eugene’s neck before he knew it. But her hand didn’t choke her.</p><p>Delicately, like touching a fragile glass marble. Noir’s fingertips caressed Eugene’s neck.</p><p>“Did you call me by that name?”</p><p>aria.</p><p>“I don’t like that name. I am not her.”</p><p>“Because I wanted to check.”</p><p>Eugene replied.</p><p>“check?”</p><p>Noir’s lips twitched. For that reason, it was very effective. In the first place, Noir did not want to reveal ‘this’ to Eugene. Someday, even if it’s revealed someday. Even if you don’t have to reveal it, you will notice each other.</p><p>I didn’t want to let people know now that my thoughts and emotions were not organized. However, the moment she heard the name ‘Arya’—- her body moved on its own.</p><p>“I need confirmation too.”</p><p>Noir’s head tilted a little further down.</p><p>In the darkness covered with wings, Eugene and Noir’s lips met.</p></div>
